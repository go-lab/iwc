Inter Widget Communication with Drag&Drop
===

Enables the inter widget communication and drag and drop between widgets
within a widget container.

## Description

Widgets are often rendered as iframes inside a widget container. The
library allows a widget to broadcast messages to other widgets open on
the page. In addition, an object can be brought from one widget to
another with drag and drop.

## Example 1: send data from one widget to another

    // require the iwc library in both src and dest widgets
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://graasp.epfl.ch/gadget/libs/iwc.min.js"></script>

    // ------- Source gadget --------
    // send some data
    iwc.publish({
      event: "select",
      type: "json",
      message: {
        data: "some text"
      }
    })

    // ------- Destination gadget --------
    // start listenning on incoming events
    iwc.connect(function (envelope, message) {
      var data = message.data
      console.log(data)
    }


## Example 2: drag&drop from one widget to another

    // require the iwc library in both src and dest widgets
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://graasp.epfl.ch/gadget/libs/iwc.min.js"></script>

    // ------- Source gadget --------
    // 'dragme' - id of the DOM node that can be dragged
    iwc.draggable('dragme', {
      // function should return the data that you want to transfer
      dragstart: function () {
        return "my data"
      }
    })

    // ------- Destination gadget --------
    // 'droparea' - id of the DOM node that accepts draged elements
    iwc.droppable('droparea', {
      drop: function (data) {
        // data - that was passed during the drop
      }
    })

## APIs
### Inter widget communication

    // start listenning on incoming events
    iwc.connect(function (envelope, message) {
      // envelope - contains extra info about the event  
      // message - object passed from one widget to another
    })

    // broadcasts event to other widgets
    iwc.publish({
      event: "select",       // type of event: select, click, etc.
      type: "json",
      message: {             // message object passed
        data: "some text"
      }
    })

### Drag and drop
  
    // turns a DOM element into a draggable object
    iwc.draggable(elemId, opts)

    opts.dragstart = function (drag) {
      // drag - object on which dragstart is executed
      return {data: "data"} // this data passed to droppable object
    }

    // turns a DOM element into a droppable object
    iwc.droppable(elemId, opts)

    opts.drop = function (data, drop, drag) {
      // data - that was passed to droppable object
      // drop - object on where the drop occured
      // drag - object that was dropped
    }

    opts.dragover = function (drop) {
      // drop - object on where the drop occured
    }
